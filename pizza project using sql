Just completed an exciting SQL project on Pizza Sales Analysis with insights guided by Ayushi Jain at WsCube Tech!

Key highlights:

âœ“ Found the most popular pizza types and their contribution to revenue

Analyzed sales trends over time

Explored data using advanced SQL queries

This experience taught me the power of data in driving business decisions. Looking forward to more data-driven projects ahead!
